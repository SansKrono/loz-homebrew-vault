# Astrolis' Binding
##### _Legendary Wondrous Item (requires attunement by a  cleric)_ 

Astrolis' Binding is a mysterious capsule adorned with a dark, starry gem that seems to capture the essence of the night sky. It is scribed with the celestial phrase 
_"Three to find, one to bind, in twilight's glow, your path unwind."_

Effect: When carried by a Twilight Domain cleric who is attuned to it, Astrolis' Binding grants the following benefits. 

**Starry Resilience**: When holding Astrolis' Binding, it exudes an invisible aura of protection on the holder, granting a +1 bonus to their AC. 

**Celestial Guidance**: Once per long rest, the cleric can use Astrolis' Binding to seek guidance from the celestial realm. This allows them to reroll one failed attack roll, saving throw, or ability check. They must use the result of the second roll.
